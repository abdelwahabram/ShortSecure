        <p class="card-text">Shortened URLs, such as those from bit.ly and goo.gl make it easy to type in a web address
            quickly, but difficult to determine where the web browser will actually take you. Criminals will use
            shortened URLs to direct victims to phishing sites or initiate a download of malicious software on to your
            device. </p>
